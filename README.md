# CreditCardRecommender
A data-driven project to create a comprehensive credit card database as the foundation for building a recommendation system. The goal is to help users find the best credit cards based on their financial behavior, spending patterns, and preferences

## 🚀 About the Project
**CreditCardRecommender** is a project focused on building a recommendation system for credit cards. The first step in this journey is to create a robust and well-structured **credit card database**. This database will act as the backbone of the recommender, storing detailed information about credit card features, benefits, and eligibility criteria.

This project marks the beginning of an innovative venture aimed at simplifying financial decisions for users while exploring advanced data-driven solutions.
